## Background
I am a competent software developer: At the age of 12 I learned the C programming language using the coveted book, &quot;Teach Yourself C Second Edition&quot; by the well-respected author Herbert Schildt. It was love at first site. At the age of 14 I was introduced to object-oriented languages, first from Java and then from C++. At the age of 19 I learned Perl. And finally by age 21 I learned C# and Ruby.

International man of mystery: I speak English, French, Hebrew, and Spanish.
