## I am a Ruby on Rails developer who has been developing robust software enjoyed by the industry since 2008

- I have created large-scale web applications, accessed by hundreds of thousands of users

- Experience in both SQL (SQL Server and MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB)

- My code is clear and maintainable. My colleagues benefit from easy-to-read code because it follows conventions

- Always keeping up-to-date with new languages and frameworks (currently learning Dart and AngularDart) and books (see my list of read books!)
