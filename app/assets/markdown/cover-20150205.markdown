## Dan Jakob Ofer is a Ruby on Rails developer in Toronto since 2008

- I have created large-scale web applications, accessed by hundreds of thousands of users

- Experience in both SQL (SQL Server and MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB)

- My code is clear and maintainable. My colleagues benefit from easy-to-read code because it follows conventions
