Both offer a convivial environment with good, respectable, and quick service. The servers and waitresses bring you delicious coffee. I recommend both the cappuchino and the mochachino. Drink one while munching on a strawberry or blueberry tart, and do not forget to a leave a small tip because this place merits it. It goes without further adieu that this place is recommended.'
